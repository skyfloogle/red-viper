Red Viper
=========

A Virtual Boy emulator for the Nintendo 3DS continuing mrdanielps's work on [r3Ddragon](https://github.com/mrdanielps/r3Ddragon),
which is itself based on Reality Boy / Red Dragon. It uses a dynamic recompiler with busywait detection and a
hardware-accelerated renderer to achieve high performance on the 3DS's limited hardware.

## Features
* All officially licensed games are playable at full speed, even on the original 3DS
* 3D support
* Game saves and savestates are supported
* 3DS display runs at 50Hz, like the Virtual Boy
* Fully customizable button mapping, including New 3DS inputs and the Circle Pad Pro
* Virtual right D-Pad or A/B buttons on the touch screen
* Configurable color palettes

## Installation

[A modded 3DS](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) is needed. Once that's sorted, you can install it using [Universal Updater](https://universal-team.net/projects/universal-updater.html).

</details>

Alternatively, the latest release can be manually downloaded [here](https://github.com/skyfloogle/red-viper/releases/latest),
provided as a 3DSX (can be loaded with Homebrew Launcher) and as a CIA (can be installed to the HOME Menu with FBI).
ROMs can be placed in any desired location on your SD card. The emulator will remember the location of the last ROM you loaded.

## Usage

ROM files need the .vb file extension to be listed. 

II menu on lower left screen pauses emulation and displays main menu.

## FAQ

> It doesn't work! / What's this DSP firmware error?

Try updating your Luma3DS installation (I tested with v13.0.2). Once it's updated, you may need to [dump your DSP firmware](https://3ds.hacks.guide/finalizing-setup#section-iii---rtc-and-dsp-setup).

> Can I use a flashcart, like Gateway 3DS?

Red Viper uses a dynamic recompiler, which requires functionality only available when Luma is installed. Flashcarts cannot provide this, and therefore unfortunately cannot run Red Viper.

> The depth slider is weird.

The Virtual Boy wasn't designed with a depth slider, so games can't have their depth scaled in the way 3DS games can. The alternative is to
shift the entire image backwards or forwards, similar to how the Virtual Boy's IPD slider works.
The default setting (3DS mode) starts at a "neutral" level and pushes the image further back as you move the slider up, keeping the metaphor fairly similar
to how most 3DS games work. Alternatively, "Virtual Boy IPD" mode can be enabled, which unlocks the full range, from closest to furthest.

To use the "default" level, use 3DS mode and keep the depth slider on, but near the bottom.

> What do the numbers in the performance info mean?

This displays the time taken for **A**ll processing in one frame, **D**RC processing (CPU emulation),
**C**itro3D processing (CPU graphics), and **P**ICA200 processing (GPU graphics). It also displays the
**M**emory usage of the DRC cache (increases over time then resets).

As this is a developer option at heart, frametimes are displayed in milliseconds rather than FPS, as the former is much easier to reason about in this context.
The target is usually 20ms, though some games only draw every other frame, so rendering has more leeway there.

## Building

After setting up [devkitPro](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment), install the
additional dependencies:
```bash
> pacman -S 3ds-zlib
```

After cloning the repository, fetch the last dependencies:
```bash
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
```

Once that's all sorted, you can choose between four different make targets:

* **`make release`** is the default, and adds `-O3` to CFLAGS.
* **`make testing`** adds `-O3` to CFLAGS. It will output basic debug info to a connected debugger.
* **`make debug`** adds `-g -O0` to CFLAGS. It builds without optimizations so it can be debugged more easily.
* **`make slowdebug`** adds `-g -O0` to CFLAGS. It will output a lot of debug information, which will slow emulation down but might be helpful to debug game-specific issues.

### Forwarders

A Virtual Boy ROM can be bundled into a Red Viper CIA, so that the game takes a space on the HOME Menu.
This can be done as follows:
1. Download New Super Ultimate Injector (NSUI), txobtool, and the CIA build of Red Viper.
2. Open NSUI, and open Tools > CIA extract and rebuild.
3. Drag red-viper.cia onto the new window, select it in the list, and extract.
4. Adjust name, icon, publisher, icon, and product code to your liking. Make sure to select the correct language. Also make sure to [generate a new title ID](https://studionamehere.github.io/HomebrewTitleIDGenerator/), as this is the unique identifier on the home menu.
5. Open the extract folder.
6. In extracted/ExtractedRomFS, place your .vb ROM file, and modify the existing "filename.txt" to contain the filename of your inserted ROM file.
7. Most of the remainder of this guide will be for modifying the banner. To start with, navigate back to the "extracted" folder in your file explorer.
8. Open a command prompt, type `cd ` followed by a space, then drag the ExtractedBanner folder into your command prompt window, then hit enter. The terminal should now display the path to your ExtractedBanner folder.
9. Drag txobtool.exe onto your command prompt window, add a space followed by ` -evfd banner.cgfx bannerout`, then hit enter. A new "bannerout" folder should be created.
10. Replace the COMMON1.png image within with a new image, with the same dimensions. Make sure the image is saved as 32-bit, or has transparent parts.
11. Drag txobtool.exe onto your command prompt window, add a space followed by ` -ivfd banner.cgfx bannerout`, then hit enter. Note that unlike step 9, with "-evfd", this one contains "-ivfd".
12. Back in NSUI, rebuild the CIA.

You should now have a "red-viper_Edited.cia" file in your extract folder. This contains your provided ROM and all the metadata changes.

Frostgiant, Parasyte, and DogP (and the rest of people that have contributed
to the VB sceen in the last five years) - Their work on Red_Dragon has been a
real inspiration. Its amazing how far they have gone with so little to start
with.

Bob VanderClay - most of the original code is based off
of his VB disassembler.

Ben Haynor - Provided me with a much better understanding of
the VB internals.

Joseph LoCicero, Dave Shadoff - I stole the jump table ideas from their tg16
disassembler, thanks guys.

Neill Corlett - took many ideas (and some code)
from his Starscream CPU core

Kevin Banks - for donating a very nice pair of Frenzle 3D
viewers, and being an all around great guy.

Megan Tucker - For putting up with my tinkering all night, and resisting the
urge to toss all my video games out the window.
