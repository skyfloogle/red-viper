A WIP Virtual Boy emulator for the 3DS. You can see the current progress [here](https://github.com/mrdanielps/r3Ddragon/wiki/Current-progress). Still needs optimizing.

Notes from NOP90

In this fork at the moment I'm only fixing little things to test the code.

Completed alignment of code to the last version of Reality Boy.

real inspiration.  Its amazing how far they have gone with so little to start
with.

Bob VanderClay (vandercl@umich.edu) - most of the original code is based off
of his VB disassembler.

Ben Haynor (bch132@psu.edu) - Provided me with a much better understanding of
the VB Internals

Joseph LoCicero, Dave Shadoff - I stole the jump table Ideas from there tg16
disassembler, thanks guys

Neill Corlett (corlett@elwha.nrrc.ncsu.edu) - took many ideas (and some code)
from his Starscream CPU core

Kevin Banks (kbanks@ro.com) - for donating a very nice pair of Frenzle 3D
viewers, and being an all around great guy

Megan Tucker - For putting up with my tinkering all night, and resisting the
urge to toss all my video games out the window
